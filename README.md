### Hi there my name is Jose Benavides and I'm a costa rican Front-End web developer with over 3 years of experience in developing web applications. I specialize in React with TypeScript but also have knowledge in Angular.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on cleaning all my repos and updating all the projects I used to show as my professional portfolio.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to code back end apps.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: jdanielbenavides@hotmail.com if it is urgent.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was really interested in programming since I was a child. I actually started studying electronics at university but life brought me back to the path of software and informatics.
-  I can speak spanish, english and a few japanese (not professional level)

Throughout my career, I've shown myself to be a dedicated and committed individual when it comes to assignments. I love to analyze problems that arise in a project and find the best solution for them. This skill allows me to work efficiently and offer innovative solutions.

In addition, I keep myself constantly updated with the latest trends and technologies in web development to be able to offer high-quality solutions. I love working in a team and collaborating with other developers to achieve common goals.
